## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Rookoo team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/rookoo/rookoo-react-native-widget/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Rookoo team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

### What to Include

Please include the following information along with your report:

- Your name and affiliation (if any)
- A description of the technical details of the vulnerabilities
- An explanation of who can exploit this vulnerability, and what they gain when doing so
- Whether this vulnerability is public or known to third parties

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access a system or account without permission
- Report any vulnerability you've discovered promptly
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience
- Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with us
- Keep information about any vulnerabilities you've discovered confidential between yourself and us until we've had 90 days to resolve the issue

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:

- Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research
- Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within 72 hours of submission)
- Recognize your contribution on our Security Researcher Hall of Fame, if you are the first to report the issue and we make a code or configuration change based on the issue
